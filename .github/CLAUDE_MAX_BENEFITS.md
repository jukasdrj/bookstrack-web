## 🚀 Claude Max Features in Your Workflow

### 1. Projects Feature (Max Plan Only)

**What it is:** Organize your repositories with persistent context

**Setup for BooksTrack:**

```
Project 1: BooksTrack Flutter
- Repository: books-flutter
- Custom instructions: Follow CLAUDE.md, use Riverpod, Material Design 3
- Knowledge: All PRDs, architecture docs, coding patterns
- Context: Remembers previous conversations about the project

Project 2: BooksTrack Swift
- Repository: books-swift
- Custom instructions: Follow Swift 6 concurrency, SwiftData, iOS HIG
- Knowledge: All PRDs, architecture docs, SwiftUI patterns
- Context: Knows about shared Cloudflare backend

Project 3: BooksTrack Backend
- Repository: cloudflare-workers
- Custom instructions: TypeScript, Cloudflare Workers patterns
- Knowledge: API contracts, Gemini integration docs
- Context: Serves both Flutter + Swift apps
```

**Benefits:**
- No need to re-explain project context
- Faster, more accurate responses
- Consistent adherence to patterns
- Team knowledge base

### 2. Unlimited Local Haiku

**What it is:** Run Haiku model locally without API costs

**Impact on Zen MCP:**

Before (without local Haiku):
```
Simple refactoring → $0.10 per task (Zen MCP API)
100 simple tasks/month → $10/month
```

After (with Claude Max):
```
Simple refactoring → $0 (local Haiku)
Unlimited simple tasks → $0
```

**Savings:** $10-50/month in API costs

### 3. Extended Context Window

**Standard Claude:** 100K tokens
**Claude Max:** 200K tokens

**What this means:**

```
Standard (100K tokens):
- Can analyze ~30-40 medium files at once
- Might lose context in long conversations

Claude Max (200K tokens):
- Can analyze 60-80 medium files
- Maintains context through complex refactoring
- Better multi-file understanding
```

**Real example:**

```
Task: "Refactor the entire scanner feature to use new API"

Standard: Might need to break into multiple sessions
Claude Max: Can analyze all 50+ files in scanner feature at once
```

### 4. Priority Access to New Features

**Recent Claude Code features (Max users got first):**
- Zen MCP integration
- Enhanced multi-file editing
- Improved code analysis
- Better project understanding

**Upcoming features you'll get first:**
- Advanced debugging tools
- Enhanced refactoring suggestions
- Team collaboration features

## 🎓 How Claude Max Enhances Each AI Tool

### Claude Code (Max Benefits)

**With Standard Plan:**
- Basic multi-file editing
- Limited context
- Standard rate limits

**With Claude Max:**
- **Projects:** Persistent knowledge per repo
- **Extended context:** Analyze entire features
- **Unlimited Haiku:** Free simple tasks
- **Priority support:** Faster help
- **Latest models:** Opus 4, Sonnet 4

**Example enhancement:**

```bash
# Standard Claude Code

# Might need manual context about patterns

# Claude Max with Projects
"Refactor the scanner feature"
# Already knows:
# - CLAUDE.md patterns
# - Previous conversations about scanner
# - Project architecture
# - Coding standards
# Result: Better, faster, more accurate refactoring
```

### Zen MCP (Max Benefits)

**Cost optimization with local Haiku:**

| Task Type | Without Max | With Claude Max |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------|
| Simple refactoring | $0.10/task | **FREE (local Haiku)** |
| Formatting | $0.05/task | **FREE (local Haiku)** |
| File operations | $0.05/task | **FREE (local Haiku)** |
| Quick questions | $0.10/task | **FREE (local Haiku)** |

**Monthly savings:** 80% of Zen MCP tasks → FREE

**Complex tasks still use premium models:**
- Security audits: Gemini 2.5 Pro ($0.50)
- Architecture: O3 Pro ($1-2)
- Deep debugging: Multi-model consensus ($1-2)

**Net effect:** Zen MCP costs drop from $20-50/month to $2-5/month

### Google Jules (Enhanced by Max)

**Jules → Claude Code handoff:**

```markdown
# Jules completes task overnight
# Creates PR

# Morning workflow with Claude Max:
"Review Jules' PR and ensure it follows our CLAUDE.md patterns"

1. Reviews PR with full project context (Projects feature)
2. Checks against CLAUDE.md (persistent knowledge)
3. Uses local Haiku for simple adjustments (free)
4. Uses Opus 4 for complex reasoning (included)
5. Makes refinements
6. Ready for human review
```

**Without Max:** Would need to re-explain patterns each time
**With Max:** Projects remember everything, instant context

## 🎯 Best Practices for Claude Max

### 1. Set Up Projects Properly

**For books-flutter:**

```
Project Name: BooksTrack Flutter
Description: Cross-platform book tracking app with AI scanner

Custom Instructions:
- Follow CLAUDE.md strictly
- Use Riverpod with code generation
- Follow Material Design 3
- Use Drift for local database
- Cloudflare Workers for backend
- Reference Flutter PRDs in product/ directory

Knowledge Files:
- CLAUDE.md
- TODO_REFINED.md
- All PRDs in product/
- GITHUB_ZEN_SETUP.md
- AI_COLLABORATION.md
```

**Benefits:**
- Never repeat project context
- Consistent code quality
- Faster responses
- Better pattern matching

### 2. Use Local Haiku Aggressively

**Default to Haiku for:**
- File operations
- Simple refactoring
- Formatting
- Quick questions
- Search/replace operations

**Claude Max makes this FREE:**

```bash
# In Claude Code
"Rename all instances of 'Book' to 'WorkDTO' in lib/core/models/"
# Uses local Haiku → FREE

"Format all files in lib/features/scanner/"
# Uses local Haiku → FREE

"Add JSDoc comments to all public methods in this file"
# Uses local Haiku → FREE
```

**Escalate to premium models only when needed:**
- Security audits
- Architecture decisions
- Complex debugging

### 3. Leverage Extended Context

**Take advantage of 200K context:**

```bash
# Analyze entire feature at once
"Review the entire scanner feature for consistency:
lib/features/scanner/ (all files)
lib/core/services/scanner_api.dart
lib/shared/widgets/scanner_*.dart
test/features/scanner/ (all tests)

Check for:
- Pattern consistency
- Error handling
- Performance issues
- Test coverage"

# Claude Max can analyze all ~80 files at once
```

**Without Max:** Would need to break into chunks

### 4. Combine with Zen MCP Wisely

**Workflow:**

```bash
# Step 1: Use Claude Max (FREE local Haiku)
"Quick refactoring of scanner providers to match new patterns"
# FREE with local Haiku

# Step 2: For deep analysis, use Zen MCP
/code-review files=lib/features/scanner/ review_type=security
# Uses Gemini 2.5 Pro (~$0.50)

# Step 3: Architecture validation with Zen MCP
/analyze files=lib/features/scanner/ type=architecture
# Uses O3 Pro (~$1-2)
```

**Cost:** $1.50-2.50 instead of $10-20 without optimization

## 💡 Power User Tips

### 1. Create Project per Repository

```
Claude Max Projects:
- books-flutter → Flutter patterns
- books-swift → Swift patterns
- cloudflare-workers → TypeScript API patterns
- personal-website → Next.js patterns
- python-api → Python/FastAPI patterns
```

**Each project remembers its own patterns!**

### 2. Use Projects for Knowledge Base

**Instead of re-explaining every time:**

```
# Without Projects:
"We use Riverpod with code generation, see CLAUDE.md section 3.2..."
(every conversation)

# With Projects:
"Add a new provider for bookshelf scanning"
(Claude Max already knows the patterns from Project knowledge)
```

### 3. Maximize Local Haiku Usage

**Track your savings:**

```
Month 1 without local Haiku: $50 in Zen MCP costs
Month 1 with Claude Max: $3 in Zen MCP costs
Savings: $47/month

Annual savings: $564
Claude Max pays for itself: After 4 months!
```

### 4. Combine All Tools Optimally

**Morning (9 AM):**
```
# Assign to Jules (Gemini Pro)
jules.google.com: "Implement reading statistics feature"
# 1 task used (60/day available)
```

**During Day:**
```
# Work with Copilot Pro+ (IDE)
Real-time autocomplete (unlimited, free)
Quick questions (uses premium requests, have 1,500/month)
```

**Afternoon (3 PM):**
```
# Jules PR ready
# Review with Claude Max (Projects context)
"Review Jules' PR for CLAUDE.md compliance"
# Uses local Haiku (FREE) or Opus 4 (included)
```

**Evening (5 PM):**
```
# Deep validation with Zen MCP
/code-review review_type=security
# Uses Gemini 2.5 Pro ($0.50)
# Only when needed, most work done by free tools
```

**Cost for entire feature:**
- Jules: Included with Gemini Pro
- Copilot: ~5-10 premium requests (~$0.20-0.40)
- Claude Max: $0 (included in subscription)
- Zen MCP: $0.50 (security audit only)

**Total AI cost per feature:** ~$0.70-0.90
**Time saved:** 10 hours ($1,000 at $100/hr)
**ROI:** 1,000x+
